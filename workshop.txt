title=[PA] No Disassembling Please!
description=[h1]Description[/h1]
description=On some servers people keep disassembling whole cities, making the world an empty place. Also players tend to pick up containers so loot respawn won't happen. If that happens on your server you can use this mod to help addressing the issue.
